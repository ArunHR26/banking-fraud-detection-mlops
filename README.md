# Banking Fraud Detection System (MLOps Focused)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a Machine Learning-powered banking fraud detection system. It highlights key aspects of the ML lifecycle, from data preprocessing and model training to interpretability and MLOps considerations, suitable for deployment in a financial institution.

## Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a significant challenge for financial institutions, leading to substantial financial losses and erosion of customer trust. This project aims to build an effective model to identify fraudulent transactions, minimizing both false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud) and false negatives (actual frauds missed).

## Dataset
The dataset used is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle, which contains anonymized transaction data with features (V1-V28) obtained via PCA transformation, along with `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class` (target variable: 0 for legitimate, 1 for fraud).

## Key Steps & Technologies

### Data Acquisition & Preprocessing
- **Secure Credential Management:** Utilized Google Colab Secrets for secure handling of Kaggle API keys.
- **Data Loading:** Pandas for efficient data handling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial data inspection, distribution analysis of features and target.
- **Imbalance Handling:** Employed **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** from `imbalanced-learn` to address the severe class imbalance inherent in fraud datasets, ensuring the model doesn't overlook the minority (fraudulent) class.
- **Feature Scaling:** Used `StandardScaler` from `scikit-learn` to normalize numerical features, optimizing model performance.
- **Data Splitting:** Stratified splitting (`train_test_split`) to maintain class proportions across training and testing sets.

### Model Development
- **Algorithm:** Implemented **XGBoost Classifier**, a powerful gradient boosting framework widely used for tabular data due to its high performance and efficiency.
- **Training:** Trained on the balanced and scaled dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Focused on industry-standard metrics for imbalanced classification:
    - **Precision:** Minimizing false positives (reducing legitimate transactions flagged as fraud).
    - **Recall:** Maximizing true positives (catching as many actual frauds as possible).
    - **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    - **ROC AUC:** Overall model performance in distinguishing classes.
    - **Confusion Matrix:** Detailed breakdown of predictions.

### Model Interpretability (Explainable AI - XAI)
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Utilized `shap` library to provide transparent insights into model predictions.
    - **Global Feature Importance:** Visualized which features have the most impact on the model's overall decisions.
    - **Individual Prediction Explanation:** Demonstrated how specific feature values contribute to an individual transaction being classified as fraudulent or legitimate, crucial for regulatory compliance and trust in financial AI systems.

### MLOps & ML Engineering Considerations (Crucial for Dutch Banks)
- **Version Control:** Project managed on **GitHub** for collaborative development, code versioning, and change tracking. This notebook is regularly committed.
- **Model Persistence:** The trained XGBoost model is saved using `joblib` for easy loading and deployment.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensured reproducibility of results using `random_state` in all relevant steps (SMOTE, train-test split, model training).
- **Future Deployment & Monitoring (Conceptual):**
    - This model can be **containerized using Docker** for consistent deployment across environments.
    - Deployment to cloud platforms like **Azure ML Services** (commonly used by Dutch banks) would involve creating pipelines for training, model registration, and endpoint creation.
    - **Model Monitoring:** In a production environment, continuous monitoring for **data drift** (changes in input data distribution) and **concept drift** (changes in the relationship between input and target, e.g., new fraud patterns) would be essential to ensure model performance remains high over time.
    - **Automated Retraining:** Establishing CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitLab CI) to automate model retraining and redeployment when performance degrades or new data becomes available.

## How to Run This Project
1.  **Clone the Repository:** `git clone [your-repo-url]`
2.  **Open in Google Colab:** Click the "Open in Colab" badge above (if available) or upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Colab.
3.  **Kaggle API Setup:**
    * Create a `kaggle.json` API token from your Kaggle account.
    * In Colab, go to the "Secrets" tab (key icon on left sidebar).
    * Add secrets: `KAGGLE_USERNAME` (your Kaggle username) and `KAGGLE_KEY` (your Kaggle API key). Ensure "Notebook access" is enabled.
